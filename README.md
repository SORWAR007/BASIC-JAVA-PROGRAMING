## JAVA BASIC PROGRAMMING
Java is a popular programming language.Java is used to develop mobile apps, web apps, desktop apps, games and much more.here some basic java program listed where we used lineae search algorithm,binary search algoritham and basic syntexes of java.we also used nected loop and diffenet conditions.

## SOFTWARE I USED:
- IntelliJ IDEA
## listed PROGRAMS ARE:
- CALCULATING SECOND HIGHEST CGPA:WE USED NESTED IF-ELSE
- ORDERING HIGHEST CGPA:WE USED NESTED IF-ELSE
- CHECKING CGPA:USED SCANNER FOT INPUT THEN USED BINARY SEARCH ALGORITHM
- CALCULATE MAX AND MIN:USED RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR AND ALSO IF ELSE 
- BREAKING DOWN INPUT FROM ARRAY:USED SCANNER AND DEFINED THE CLASS FROM MAIN CLASS
- NUMBER PATTERN:USED  TWO LOOP: DESENDING AND ASENDING
- FIND OUT LOWEST NUMBER.TOOK SCANNER AND NEXTED LOOPS
-  Count number of words, number of characters without spaces, number of vowels and consonant
-  Find the number of occurrences of characters in a String: USED HASHMAP
-  Print the  numbers which are not duplicate from the given array:USED ARRAAYLIST AND LOOP
-  Remove Vowels from a String
-  A core i 7 laptop price is 85000 tk and a gaming mouse price is 2500 tk. If I buy the laptop and 1 piece mouse, what will be my total cost after giving 15% discount?
